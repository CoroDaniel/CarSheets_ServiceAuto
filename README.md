# CarSheets_ServiceAuto
I created a web application with ASP.NET Core that facilitates the activity of a car service. 
The administrator will be able to enter in the database: customers, types of cars and 
will be able to create the car sheets in which different data are entered and saved in the database.
Later, when an older customer returns, the process will be faster because the customer is already in the database and will only be chosen in the car sheet.
